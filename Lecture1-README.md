# Introduction to C++
This file contains information about basics of c++ and why so we need c++


## What is a Programming Language
Programming language is a language that helps programmers to communicate with the computers.

## Why learn C++ instead of other Programming languages
* It provides more efficiency
* Has strong abstraction capabilities
* contains STL(Standard Template Library)
* Strong typing and compile_time checks

## What is an IDE
* IDE stands for Integrated Development environment. It provides user interface for coding.
* Helps to write code faster and in efficient way.
* Example- VS Code, Dec C++, Turbo C

## Difference between Low level and high level language
* High level languages are human understandable languages and low level languages are computer understandable languages.
* Every programming language is high level language and it is converted to low level Language by compilation.

## What is a Compiler
It translates programming language source code to low level Machine Language i.e 0s and 1s.
